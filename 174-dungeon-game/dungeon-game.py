        if we want to find the minimum initial health, starting from (0,0) is bad 
        Some paths might take huge damage early, and some might take less.

        u would need to consider all paths and track the minimum initial health over all paths, which is messy.

        change POV: if im at i,j what is the minimum amount of health i needed to save the princess

        what is the subproblem?
