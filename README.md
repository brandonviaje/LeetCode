# LeetCode Submissions

This repository is a personal archive of my **accepted solutions** on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Every file here represents a problem I've successfully solved. I do it for the love of the game....

## Contents

- Only correct/accepted solutions are included. ✅ 
- Solutions are mostly unedited from submission — they may be brute force or optimal depending on the attempt.
- Organized by language and/or topic depending on how I was solving them.

## Languages
- Python
- Java
- C++

I'm probably gonna add new languages later on but I plan on just writing it in these three.

## Purpose

- Track my progress solving LeetCode problems
- Serve as a reference for revisiting problems later
- Help reinforce patterns and techniques over time

## Notes

- This repo isn't meant to showcase polished code.
- I may revisit and optimize some solutions in the future.
- Feel free to browse for inspiration, but I recommend solving problems on your own first!
