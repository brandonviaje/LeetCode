# 📝 LeetCode Submissions

This repository is a personal archive of my **accepted solutions** on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Every file here represents a problem I've successfully solved.

## 📁 Contents

- ✅ Only correct/accepted solutions are included.
- 🧪 Solutions are mostly unedited from submission — they may be brute force or optimal depending on the attempt.
- 🗂️ Organized by language and/or topic depending on how I was solving them.

I tend to only post the most optimal solutions, so you won't see a lot of brute force here.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Track my progress solving LeetCode problems
- Serve as a reference for revisiting problems later
- Help reinforce patterns and techniques over time

## 🛠️ Notes

- This repo isn't meant to showcase polished code.
- I may revisit and optimize some solutions in the future.
- Feel free to browse for inspiration, but I recommend solving problems on your own first!
